# Your "Local" Library

## What is it

Your Local Library is your well.. local library meaning that it's there to store all of the books you have in library at home. Every book you have at home you can store here.

This was created as a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to learn and practice javascript.

## What can I do with it

You are able to locally store every book you have at home and in your possession. All you have to do is click the "Add Book" button in the left corner above the table. Clicking that will then let a form appear that will ask you for the title of the book, the author, how many pages it has, and if you have already read and finished it or not. It will then store and display that information in the table dynamically.

Using the display you can then change the read status of the book. Did you accidentally click read when it hasn't been? Or did you finish the book after the fact? Changing the read status will update the stored status to the new selection! You can even delete a book from the storage if need be as well.
